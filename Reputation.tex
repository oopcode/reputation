\section{Overview}

This document describes the reputation system that is used to characterise agents in the SONM network. Motivation: lost profit for sellers, lost time for buyers, etc.

\section{Basic notions}

The SONM ecosystem consists of \textit{buyers} and \textit{sellers}. Buyers rent computational resources from sellers to run arbitrary \textit{tasks}; a deal is made for a specific resource configuration and a specific period of time (i.e., not per task).

When looking for a seller, a buyer searches the \textit{marketplace}. A deal made via marketplace is called a \textit{public} deal.

Any deal can have three possible outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mutual satisfaction}. Buyer is satisfied with the service provided by seller, no 
\end{itemize}
